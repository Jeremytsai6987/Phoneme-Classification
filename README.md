## Overview
This Phoneme Classification project aims to leverage the rich dataset provided by the DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus to develop a model capable of accurately classifying phonemes, the smallest units of sound in speech. By applying advanced machine learning techniques, this project seeks to contribute to the field of speech recognition, enhancing the ability of computers to understand and process spoken language.

## Introduction
Phoneme classification stands at the core of many speech recognition systems, enabling the conversion of spoken language into text by identifying distinct units of sound. This project focuses on the classification task using the TIMIT corpus, renowned for its detailed phonetic annotations and diverse dialect sampling. The objective is to develop a model that not only achieves high accuracy in phoneme classification but also deepens our understanding of speech recognition challenges.

## Data Preparation
The TIMIT corpus, comprising recorded speech from multiple English speakers with diverse accents, serves as the foundation for our data. We conducted several preprocessing steps to enhance model performance:

- **Audio Signal Processing**: Conversion of raw audio signals into spectrograms to capture the temporal and spectral dimensions of sound.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extraction of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to represent the phonetic characteristics effectively.
- **Data Augmentation**: Application of techniques like noise injection and speed variation to increase the robustness of our model to variations in speech.
- **Train-Test Split**: Division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.

## Model Building
We explored various models, ultimately selecting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for its efficacy in handling the spatial hierarchy of features in spectrograms. The model architecture includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, with ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity. Dropout layers were added to prevent overfitting. The model was trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function, optimized with Adam optimizer for efficient convergence.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Our model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy], indicating a high level of precision in phoneme classification.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: These metrics provided further insight into the model's ability to classify phonemes correctly without significant bias or error.

## Conclusion
The Phoneme Classification project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in accurately classifying phonemes within the TIMIT corpus. While the model shows promising results, ongoing work includes exploring the integration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to better capture temporal dependencies in speech data. Future directions also involve testing the model's performance across different languages and dialects, aiming for a more inclusive and versatile speech recognition system.
